How to use:
- Step 0: Open DevTools Panel (F12 or Right Click -> select 'Inspect')
- Step 1: Right Click -> select 'Freeze DOM'  or Press Cmd + Shift + Y (on Mac) / Cmd + Shift + Y (on Window, Ubuntu)

Right click on tab content and choose "Freeze DOM" (while devtool panel is open) to freeze the state of website on demand.

With a frozen DOM, you can:
- Inspect an UI part that only available while hovered / focused (for example: keeping the auto complete dropdown of a text input visible)
- Take a snapshot of an in-progress state (for example: loading state)
